# A-vs-Dijkstra
Comparison between A* and Dijkstra pathfinding algorithms

I wrote this code for a talk on pathfinding, that I gave in a computer science lesson.
It uses HTML5 and JavaScript instead of Java or something like that to handle all the compatibility terrors of my school's computers.

When the pathfinding is currently not running you can edit the map by simply clicking on any of its fields. Depending on what field type is selected in the combo box either the starting point or the target moves or a wall is placed or removed.
Then press start. Now you can make single steps to see how the algorithm works or just finish. Unvisited but regarded fields are light blue, visisted fields are dark blue and the final way that the algorithm has computed is yellow.
